# Butternut Box - Front End Developer Task

This repo contains the submission of my developer task for a Front End Developer position at Butternut Box.

A online version of this task can also be found at http://butternutbox.jamesbovis.com

## Getting started

To clone this repo, run `git clone https://github.com/St3ve89/butternut-box-fe-task.git` into your terminal.

When the project has been downloaded, move into the folder by typing `cd Butternut-Box-Task`. Now, once your in the Butternut-Box-Task folder, run `npm install` to download the dependencies.

Once finished, running `npm run sass` will compile the SASS into a css. You can open `index.html` with a `live-server` extension and the browser window will be refreshed automatically.

## Notes

This project uses [7-1 Sass architecture](https://sass-guidelin.es/#architecture). 7 folders, 1 file (in this project didn't have to create all the folders) for split the codebase into meaningful separated folders so it is easy to find everything later when you have to come back to the code.
